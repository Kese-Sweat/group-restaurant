        <p>In Cambodia, the heat forces people to eat little and often, and street food lends itself well to this rhythm.
             A num pang, prepared in minutes on super light, crisp-crusted baguette, slicked with chilli sauce and stuffed with
              a pleasantly rubbery meatloaf called pate is the perfect snack. The pickled vegetables, although similar to banh mi in that they’re usually carrot and
               daikon are cut much thinner, therefore losing their crunch; I can’t say I was really that into them. For this recipe then, I’ve made a cucumber and shallot 
               pickle which adds the requisite sweet and sourness while also bringing plenty of texture.</p>

        <p>I’ll share a more traditional recipe in the next week or so but I’ve had these seafood cakes on the brain and had to get them out of my system. They’re
             based on the bouncy fish or prawn cakes found all over East and South East Asia but I’ve added some crab to mine because: crab. The bounciness of these cakes 
             usually comes from pounding or blending raw fish but since I was using 50/50 raw prawns and cooked crab I also added an egg white to be on the safe side. I’d say the
              texture is somewhere between springy and soft, which is pretty ideal for a sandwich situation.
